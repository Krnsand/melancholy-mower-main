# Intro
We should add Elevenlabs voice agent to let our users talk to the mower. 

# Random thoughts

- Use context7 to understand how voice agents API for elevenlabs works.
- We'll design one or more custom voices, so this id is needed somewhere in the settings.
- Maybe we need to store the elevenlabs agent id, too? 

# Outcome

When I've created a setting and hit play, I should be able to start talking to the mower.
